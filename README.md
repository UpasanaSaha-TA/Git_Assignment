# 01- Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will learn and practice some basic tools every developer should be comfortable with.

**Exercises**

1. Go through the following tutorial on Unix shell:
https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

**Record your shell session and submit it (see note below on how to record your session)**

2. Install Git on your Ubuntu app

```$  sudo apt get install git```

Read through the excellent reference on GIT : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. Please make sure to go through chapters 1,2,3, 6 and also appendix A-1 on configuring your editor/IDE.

Pls. go through the hands-on exercises in the book and try it out using a private repo on GitHub. **Record your session and submit it and share the GitHub repository.**

3. Install Miniconda (not Conda enterprise or navigator) on your ubuntu App from the following link (use the linux 64 bit installer):
	[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Go through the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) and try out the commands in the guide. **Record your session and submit it.**


<u><b>NOTE</b></u>


Please record your Unix tutorial session, Git tutorial sessions and Conda session using the <i><b>script</b></i> shell command:

```$ script -a ~/my_unix_session```     # start recording your session

The above command starts a recording session and saves all the shell commands and outputs to a text file named my_unix_session in your home directory. The `-a` flag instructs the tool to append to the file if it already exists.

```$ exit```                         # exit recording your session

The above command will stop the recording session. **Submit the text file containing the recorded session.**

<u><b>Deliverables</b></u>
1. Recorded sessions for Unix tutorial, Git tutorial and the Conda tutorial.
2. A link to the GitHub repository used for the Git tutorial.
